# TeamProfileGenerator

# About
This program creates a webpage to show team members at a company and there respective profiles, things like email and github.
It also runs some initialization data test on the classes that were used to construct it.  Node.js, a server side api is used to
input the data to be displayed on the website. 

# Usage
Anyone with knowledge of the command line should be able to run this program.
I  used HTML, javascript, CSS and Node.js. to create this program.
