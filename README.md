# TeamProfileGenerator

# About
This program creates a webpage to show team members at a company and there respective profiles, things like email and github.
It also runs some initialization data test on the classes that were used to construct it.  Node.js, a server side api is used to
input the data to be displayed on the website. The email and Github text fields are links that will take you to an email program 
and Github site respectively. I mistakenly put some of the classes source in the 'dist' folder instead of a 'source' folder, just
wanted to let whoever's reading this to know to avoid confusion.


# Usage
Anyone with knowledge of the command line should be able to run this program.
I  used HTML, javascript, CSS and Node.js. to create this program.
